# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
<br>

> Upon **_creating an account and logging in_**, users can **_shorten_**, **_edit_** and **_delete_** URLs. User accounts are protected with **_cookies and password encryption_** using cookies-session, bcrypt, hash, and salt. This ensures that only authenticated users can access their URL storage.

This is my second project at LHL after [Lotide](https://github.com/Sohaib-GO/lotide) - a mini clone of [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.
